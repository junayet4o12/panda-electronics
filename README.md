## About My Web side :

* __Design:__ My web side design is a unique design. It has many features for users and clients. First, it's a responsive web site. It means, It is acceptable for every device like pc, laptop, mobile, tablet etc. and its color combination is in next level.

* __Toggle-theme:__ Its a unique and a useful feature in my web side. some people likes light theme and some people like dark theme. So for the all users I've provided a feature that users can choose their liked theme. and even they can use both light and dark by toggling. 

* __Frontend:__ My frontend is a great attractive element of my design. It makes the webpage more clear and more bugs free and more userfrindly. its animation, its theme, its button toggoling and onclick button function everything has become possible by my frontend developing.

 * __Backend:__ Now, My backend developing is in next level. Couse, Now I have used Mongo db as backend server. It stores all data which is add by clients. and even client can remove data, add data, update data everything he/she want. its very fluent and bugs free. and its possible for mongodb. User also can add product to their own address.

 * __Firebase Authentication:__ Its very important in my web page. Couse only it can save my web from awful users. If any clients want to access my web page, at first he need to log in or sign up in my page. and it is possibled by firebase. Fire base is used as a server for logged in users data. it store logged in users data and it also check who is visiting my web. so user cant access others data.
